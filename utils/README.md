TODO:

[] - Add explicit caching to Table object with `cache()` and `clear_cache()` methods and remove all implicit caching in data update functions. Instead invalidate the cache on update and raise a CacheError when the cache isn't explicitly cleared and rebuilt after modification operations or when the row count stored in the table object doesn't match the row count of a search cursor. This will still possibly cause issues if a user modifies a table with another Table object instance, but that will be addressed in a later update.
